# neuralbitbot

Produce in collaboration with Michael Welsh.
Using a micro:bit based bitbot from 4tronix to produce a potential teaching tool; an example of artificial neurons used control a robot. The aim is for this tool to be used with 3rd-year Undergraduates, as part of a module on Artificial Intelligence.

The solution was to use the computer to run and train a single neuron; then for the robot to send values from the line sensors back to the program running on a Computer and receive control signals. 

The software runs on the computer had to also send and receive the data through a microbit (via USB) and then use radio to communicate with the bit:bot robot. Implemented in Python
